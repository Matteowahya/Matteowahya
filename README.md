- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matteowahya.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and everything related to this field.
      After graduating in anthropology i decided to let my love for social sciences and computer science collide into new paths that I have just started to explore.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some useful libraries and modules to improve my data science skills in python and improving my not-still-so pythonic coding skills.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate in some social science project with a quantitative analytic approach - this will be the next step when I'll feel ready to do so.
- 📫 Please contact me here on Github
